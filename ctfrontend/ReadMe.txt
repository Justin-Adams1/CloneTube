Hello!

I created this project during my 10th week of school. It was the first time interacting with an outside API, and it really was the gateway to my Full Stack Career. 

It is a basic clone of youtube, which allows a user to leave comments in a custom backend and render live with an active search function and related videos.

Please feel free to check out my other projects!
